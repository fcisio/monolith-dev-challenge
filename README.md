# Gatsby Locomotive Scroll Starter

### This starter is based of Gatsby's default starter. For information on this tool, [see the original repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

This project aims to provide a minimal base for building sites with Gatsby in combination with [Locomotive Scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll)

[See the demo](https://gatsby-locomotive-scroll-starter.netlify.app/)

## Dev Challenge

#### Notes
- Usage of [Gatsby Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) is recommended.
- Use SASS, Styled Components or both.
- Do not use any framework: Bootstrap, Foundation, ...
- Use [Unsplash API](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-unsplash/) to populate images (Gatsby Plugin)
- The features should be implemented with Locomotive Scroll, GSAP and CSS Animations
- The end result should be close to the mockup, but it doesnâ€™t need to be perfect. We mainly want to see the placement, responsiveness and features.
- Publish the project on Netlify and send us the URL

1. Clone this repo and integrate the mockups.
2. Implement as many features as possible.
3. Publish the end result on Netlify and send un the URL along with a link to the repository.
